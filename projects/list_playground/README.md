# List Playground

A simple command-line tool to experiment with linked lists in Rust.

## Usage

Run the program with `cargo run`.

The program demonstrates basic linked list operations such as creating, appending, and printing elements.

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more linked list operations (insert, delete, reverse).
*   Add error handling.
*   Allow user input to manipulate the list.
