# Env Revealer

A simple command-line tool to inspect environment variables.

## Usage

Run the program to display all environment variables and their values.

```bash
cargo run
```

You can also filter environment variables by providing a search term:

```bash
cargo run -- filter
```

This will display only environment variables that contain the word "filter".
